In this case (sending Notifies) I think the interpretation is at least manageable. \r\n\r\nAs a case in point, I have code that sends both a Notify(CDS) and a Notify(CSYNC) in the same message to my test service. This has a rather obvious interpretation and works perfectly.\r\n\r\nRegarding attaching the RRSIGs to, eg. the Notify(CDS) I don't see how that would solve the problem with garbage Notifications as both the RR and the RRSIG(RR) are publically available. The only thing this would do is to make it trivially more complicated to construct the garbage. \r\n\r\nTo my mind the way to deal with the risk of garbage Notifications is the same as for normal Notifies (i.e. Notify(SOA)): ensure that receipt of a Notify does not in any way change the logic for what is required for the zone to be updated. In the Notify(SOA) case this is well known (secondary queries for the SOA, only a bit earlier than otherwise, and makes a decision). In the Notify(CDS) or Notify(CSYNC) cases I believe in similar logic: do the same scan as would otherwise happen later and make the same decision as would otherwise still have happened.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the way to deal with garbage notifications becomes, I hope, mostly a matter of guarding the service with some sort of reasonable rate-limiting defence.",

The Registrant would use some well-known publication point (underscore name), and sign the record (preventing forgery).\r\n\r\nRegistrar would discover the publication point via polling, and then acknowledge at its own publication point, allowing the Registrant to know it is okay to use the address (however that address is learned.)",

In my experience (primarily with PowerDNS), this requires making configuration changes at the primary server to make it aware of the current list of NOTIFY(SOA) targets. In PowerDNS this information is stored in 'zone metadata' (outside of the zone contents), but this draft provides a way for that metadata to be both standardized and stored within the zone contents.\r\n\r\nThe ability to host a NOTIFY(SOA) record for each target, combined with the ability for those targets to use TSIG-authenticated UPDATE to add (or remove) their own NOTIFY(SOA) records, would provide a nice solution to this problem.",

It would need to be standardized; but the basic idea probably is clear.)\r\n- [ ] Send an EDNS0 Report-Channel option in the NOTIFY message (RFC 9567).

The problem is that this creates pressure on the receiver to come to a conclusion within seconds, which may not be acceptable given that DS provisioning may take longer (including bootstrapping fetches, acceptance checks etc.). Related: #11 \r\n- [ ] Allow the DNS operator to publish a reporting endpoint under their nameserver, e.g. `_notify-report.$child._signal.ns1.provider.net`, or similar (need not be child-specific).
